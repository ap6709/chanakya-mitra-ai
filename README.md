## üöÄ Core Components

### 1. Chanakya-Mitra (The AI Friend)
A Supabase-powered, AI-assisted chatbot designed to provide curated, safe answers for students (Grades 1-6). It uses a hybrid model:
1.  **Curated Database:** Pulls pre-approved answers from a Supabase table.
2.  **Generative AI:** Uses the Google Gemini API (with strict safety prompts) for questions not in the database.
3.  **Admin Dashboard:** A tool for teachers to review questions and "approve" new AI answers, constantly making the bot smarter and saving man-hours.

### 2. Chanakya's Circuit Crackers (CCC)
The official student tech club for this project. The CCC members are the core development team for "Chanakya-Mitra" and also manage the "Tinker Treasure Chest" ‚Äì a school-wide initiative to collect and repurpose e-waste into new, creative electronics projects.

## üóìÔ∏è 3-Month "Build-and-Teach" Syllabus

This syllabus outlines our development and learning plan, with 3 hours of mentorship per week (6 sessions of 30 minutes each).

**Mentor:** Abhishek Pradhan
**Group:** "Chanakya-Mitra Dev & CCC Core"

### Month 1: The Foundation (Database & Physical Club)
**Goal:** Launch the CCC, start the e-waste drive, and build the *non-AI* part of the bot. We will make the bot answer its very first pre-programmed question.

* **Week 1:** Project Kick-off & The "What"
* **Week 2:** Building the "Cabinet" (Supabase DB)
* **Week 3:** Building the "Face" (Basic Chat UI)
* **Week 4:** The First "Win" & Tinker-Techs

### Month 2: The "Smart" Layer (Generative AI & Admin)
**Goal:** Integrate Google's Gemini API for questions the bot *doesn't* know. Build the Admin Dashboard so teachers can easily add new answers.

* **Week 5:** The "What If...?" Problem (Intro to GenAI)
* **Week 6:** Building the "Hybrid Brain" (Edge Function)
* **Week 7:** The Admin Dashboard (Saving Man-Hours)
* **Week 8:** The "Magic Button" (Self-Improving AI)

### Month 3: "Going Wild" (Advanced & Deployment)
**Goal:** Make the bot "smarter" (handling spelling mistakes) and deploy it for a real-world test with one class.

* **Week 9:** Making the Bot *Understand* (Vector Search)
* **Week 10:** The *Real* Smart Search
* **Week 11:** Deployment & Testing
* **Week 12:** Review, Feedback & Future
